examples with Vicare Scheme.


1. Demo networking servers
--------------------------

1.1 ECHO server
---------------

SYNOPSIS

   vicare echod.sps [vicare options] [-- [echod options]]

DESCRIPTION

The script "echod.sps" implements the  classic echo server: if we
connect to it and send it strings, it will just echo them back to
the client.  By default it listens to localhost:8081.

  Internally it makes use of the following notable libraries:

   (vicare posix)
   (vicare posix pid-files)
   (vicare simple-event-loop)
   (srfi :37 args-fold)

this demo  program is  especially a  demonstration of  the Simple
Event Loop library.


1.2 SHELLD server
-----------------

To be written.


1.3 HTTP server
---------------

		 *THIS PROGRAM is NOT FINISHED*

The script "httpd.sps"  is a *toy* web server  capable of serving
pages  from a  customisable  document root  directory.  Start  it
with:

   $ vicare demos/httpd.sps -- \
	--document-root /path/to/root

and  terminate it  by sending  it a  SIGINT signal  (Ctrl-c).  By
default the server binds itself to localhost:8080.
