			  Demo scripts
			  ============


This directory  contains scripts  and data files  showing program
examples with Vicare Scheme.


1. Demo networking servers
--------------------------

1.1 ECHO server
---------------

The script "echod.sps" implement the classic echo demo server: if
we connect to it and send it strings, it will just echo them back
to the client.  By default is listens to localhost:8081.

  Internally it makes use of the following notable libraries:

   (vicare posix)
   (vicare simple-event-loop)
   (srfi :37 args-fold)


1.2 SHELLD server
-----------------

To be written.


1.3 HTTP server
---------------

		 *THIS PROGRAM is NOT FINISHED*

The script "httpd.sps"  is a *toy* web server  capable of serving
pages  from a  customisable  document root  directory.  Start  it
with:

   $ vicare demos/httpd.sps -- \
	--document-root /path/to/root

and  terminate it  by sending  it a  SIGINT signal  (Ctrl-c).  By
default the server binds itself to localhost:8080.
