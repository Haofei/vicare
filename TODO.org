* Overall project goals

** Document the assembler

** Document the compiler

** Document undocumented functions

* List of functions to be documented


  Some of  these may  be internal functions  which must be  removed from
  "makefile.sps".  Not  all the undocumented functions  are listed here,
  only the ones known not to be documented.

** ikarus.symbols.ss

   gensym-count
   top-level-value top-level-bound? set-top-level-value!
   symbol-value symbol-bound? set-symbol-value!
   reset-symbol-proc! system-value system-value-gensym
