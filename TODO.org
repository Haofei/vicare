* Overall project goals

** Document the assembler

** Document the compiler

** Document undocumented functions

* Code known to be reviewed

** ikarus.io.ss

   Solve all the FIXME issues

   If SET-PORT-POSITION!  fails it is  possible for the field POS of the
   cookie to become invalid.  Should the port be marked as corrupted?

   Functions still to be reviewed:

	tcp-connect tcp-connect-nonblocking
	udp-connect udp-connect-nonblocking
	tcp-server-socket tcp-server-socket-nonblocking
	accept-connection accept-connection-nonblocking
	close-tcp-server-socket

* Miscellaneous stuff to be fixed

** ikarus.io.ss

*** Crash because of "invalid frame size"

   Something is causing an "invalid  frame size" error with some builds.
   I guess it is caused by something in the I/O module, particularly the
   guardian used to close garbage  collected ports.  For this reason the
   CLOSE-PORT call in the guardian  cleanup function is commented out to
   test if  the problem  still manifests itself.   Once fixed,  the call
   must be reincluded.

*** errno codes

   This library is using  "normalised" errno codes: platform's own errno
   codes are  converted by the C  function "ik_errno_num_to_code()" into
   codes  in the  POSIX IEEE  Std 1003.1  2004 Edition.   This  looks so
   fascinating!

   But is it also good?

   Today,  Vicare   ships  with  a  (vicare   errno)  library  exporting
   identifier   syntaxes  expanding  to   platform's  own   errno  codes
   determined by the "configure" script.  These are the ones that should
   be used by  libraries depending upon Vicare's FFI.   Notice that this
   library is NOT compatible  with "ikrt_strerror()", which requires the
   normalised codes.

** ikarus.symbols.ss

   The name of  generated symbols embeds a numeric  counter which is the
   stringification of a fixnum.   What if generating many symbols causes
   the counter to overflow the fixnums?

* List of functions to be documented

  Some of  these may  be internal functions  which must be  removed from
  "makefile.sps".  Not  all the undocumented functions  are listed here,
  only the ones known not to be documented.

** low level

   $flonum-sbe
   $init-symbol-function!

** ikarus.symbols.ss

   gensym-count
   top-level-value top-level-bound? set-top-level-value!
   reset-symbol-proc! system-value system-value-gensym

** ikarus.io.ss

   reset-input-port!
   reset-output-port!

* List of functions to be tested

  The flonum getters  and setters in the bytevector  library should have
  tests in "test-vicare-bytevectors.sps".

* Stuff to think about for the future

** Introduce immutable datums

   Strings  and  bytevectors  read   from  the  source  code  should  be
   immutable.

** Unique strings in compiled code

   Equal strings read from different places in the source code should be
   stored only once in the FASL file.

** Shared memory

   Rely on OSSP mm to handle shared memory between forked processes?

** Inline assembly

   Is it possible  and convenient to replace assembly  code inlined in C
   sources with code generated by GNU Lightning?

** Foreign functions interface

   Crazy?  Is  it possible  to replace the  dependency upon  libffi with
   code generated at runtime by GNU Lightning?

** Event loop

   Optionally rely on libev for a sophisticated internal event loop?

** glibc interesting functions

*** asynchronous input/output

    Could it work with Vicare?

** Linux interesting functions
