The library @library{vicare containers sets-and-bags} implements sets
and bags; sets and bags (also known as multisets) are unordered
collections that can contain any Scheme object.

This library is actually the reference implementation of @ansrfi{113}
adapted to @value{PRJNAME}.  The library exports the same syntactic
bindings of the library @library{srfi :113 sets-and-bags}.  @ref{srfi
sets-and-bags, @ansrfi{113} sets and bags}, for the documentation.
