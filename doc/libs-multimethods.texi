@cindex Library @library{vicare language-extensions multimethods}


In the context of the library @library{vicare language-extensions
multimethods}: @dfn{generic functions}, or @dfn{multimethods}, are
interfaces to procedures that can be specialised to the (possibly
conventional) data types of their arguments; each specialisation of a
generic function is called @dfn{method}.  When applying a generic
function to a tuple of arguments, the most specific method with respect
to the arguments' types is chosen.

The library defines two kinds of generic functions: ordinary and
starred.  @dfn{Ordinary generic functions} only have one (primary)
method for each possible tuple of argument types.  @dfn{Starred generic
functions} may have qualified primary, before, after and around methods
for each possible tuple of argument types; the methods are applied
(composed) according to a defined protocol.

Multimethods are meant to be used with the typed language.

@section Examples of method dispatching


Here we look at some examples of what we have to expect from
multimethods dispatching.  We will always assume that the code in the
examples is wrapped into a @syntax{program} form as follows:

@lisp
#!vicare
(program (demo)
  (options typed-language)
  (import (vicare)
    (vicare language-extensions multimethods))

  ... ;here goes the code

  #| end of program |# )
@end lisp

Let's examine an example using the generic functions definer
@func{define-generic}:

@example
(define-record-type <one>                  (nongenerative one))
(define-record-type <two>   (parent <one>) (nongenerative two))
(define-record-type <three> (parent <two>) (nongenerative three))
@end example

@noindent
the type hierarchy is:

@example
<top> -> <struct> -> <record> -> <one> -> <two> -> <three>
@end example

@noindent
the list of @uid{}s for @class{three} is:

@example
(type-unique-identifiers <three>)
@result{} (three two one
    vicare:scheme-type:<record>
    vicare:scheme-type:<struct>
    vicare:scheme-type:<top>)
@end example

@noindent
so for the generic function:

@example
(define-generic doit (o))
(define-method (doit @{o <one>@}) 'one)
(define-method (doit @{o <two>@}) 'two)
@end example

@noindent
applied to a value of type @class{three}: the method with @class{two} in
the signature is @emph{more specific} than the method with @class{one}
in the signature:

@example
(doit (new <three>)) @result{} two
@end example

@noindent
also the method with @class{one} in the signature is the ``next method''
of the method with @class{two} in the signature, we can call it using
@func{call-next-method}.  The following example shows a call to the next
method:

@example
(define-generic fluff (o))

(define-method (fluff @{o <one>@})
  'one)

(define-method (fluff @{o <two>@})
  (cons 'two (call-next-method)))

(define o (new <three>))

(fluff o)
@result{} (two . one)
@end example

The syntax @func{define-generic} defines a macro which can be used as a
function; the syntax @func{define-method} adds a new method to the
generic function; @func{define-generic} establishes the number of
arguments for the generic function: all the methods must have the same
number of arguments.

It is possible to define a function accepting different numbers of
arguments as follows:

@example
(case-define fluff
  ((a)
   (fluff-1 a))
  ((a b)
   (fluff-2 a b))
  ((a b . rest)
   (fluff-3 a b rest)))

(define-generic fluff-1 (o))
(define-generic fluff-2 (o p))
(define-generic fluff-3 (o p rest))

(define-method (fluff-1 @{o <one>@})
  ---)

(define-method (fluff-2 @{o <one>@} @{p <two>@})
  ---)

(define-method (fluff-3 @{o <one>@} @{p <two>@} rest)
  ---)
@end example

@noindent
this way we turn a set of macros into a single ``generic function''
which is truly a function.  If we avoid wrapping the macros into a
function we may gain a bit of speed in function calls.

@node multimethods application
@section How generic functions and methods are invoked


The library @library{vicare language-extensions multimethods} is
designed to work with type definitions from the library @library{vicare}
(@class{fixnum}, @class{string}, et cetera); these types and their
hierarchy are identified by unique symbols (@uid{}).  For example:

@lisp
(type-unique-identifiers <string>)
@result{} (vicare:scheme-type:<string>
    vicare:scheme-type:<top>)
@end lisp

Every method has arguments specified by a tuple of type identifiers; for
example, the method definition:

@lisp
(define-method (fluff @{A <string>@} @{B <struct>@} @{C <top>@})
  ---)
@end lisp

@noindent
has arguments specified by the tuple of identifiers:

@lisp
(<string> <struct> <top>)
@end lisp

Every tuple of operands to which a multimethod is applied is associated
to a tuple of type identifiers; for example, in the multimethod
application:

@lisp
(define @{B <struct>@} ---)
(define @{C <top>@}    ---)
(fluff "ciao" B C)
@end lisp

@noindent
the type of the operands is specified by the tuple of type identifiers:

@lisp
(<string> <struct> <top>)
@end lisp

This way each tuple of method's arguments and each tuple of operands is
associated to a tuple of @uid{}s lists.  For example, the tuple of type
identifiers:

@lisp
(<string> <struct> <top>)
@end lisp

@noindent
is associated to the tuple of @uid{} lists:

@lisp
((vicare:scheme-type:<string> vicare:scheme-type:<top>)
 (vicare:scheme-type:<struct> vicare:scheme-type:<top>)
 (vicare:scheme-type:<top>))
@end lisp

A tuple of @uid{} lists is called @dfn{signature}.  Each multimethod
holds an internal collection in which every method's closure object is
associated to a signature.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Ordinary multimethods

Ordinary multimethods allow the association of a single method to a type
signature.  When an ordinary multimethod is applied to a tuple of
operands, the following happens:

@enumerate
@item
For each operand a type is determined and the list of @uid{}s
representing the type hierarchy is acquired.  The operands' signature is
formed.

@item
The internal collection of methods is queried for all the methods
applicable to the tuple of operands, using the operands' signature as
search key.

@item
The list of applicable methods is sorted from the most specific to the
least specific for the operands' signature.  From now on the list of
sorted, applicable methods is handled as a stack.

@item
The next method is popped from the stack and its closure applied to the
tuple of arguments; the return value of this application becomes the
return value of the generic function application.  If the function calls
its ``next method'': recurse to step 4 (@pxref{multimethods next,
Invoking the next method}).
@end enumerate

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Starred multimethods

Starred multimethods allow the definition of four qualified methods:
@code{:primary}, @code{:around}, @code{:before} and @code{:after}; we
can think of ordinary multimethods as starred generics supporting only
@code{:primary} methods.  The short description is that: @code{:around}
methods are applied first, then @code{:before}, @code{:primary} and
@code{:after} methods are applied in this order.

For each method qualification (@code{:primary}, @code{:around},
@dots{}): a starred multimethod holds an internal collection in which
every method's closure is associated to an arguments' signature.

When a starred multimethod is applied to a tuple of operands, the
following happens:

@enumerate
@item
For each operand a type is determined and the list of @uid{}s
representing the type hierarchy is acquired.  The operands' signature is
formed.

@item
For each method qualification: the internal collection is queried for
all the methods applicable to the tuple of operands, using the operands'
signature as search key.

@item
For each method qualification: the list of applicable methods is sorted
from the most specific to the least specific for the operands'
signature.  The list of @code{:after} methods is reversed: from the
least specific to the most specific.
@end enumerate

From now on the lists of sorted applicable methods are handled as
stacks; the stacks of @code{:primary}, @code{:around} and @code{:before}
methods have the most specific method on the top; the stack of
@code{:after} methods has the least specific method on the top.

From now on the application of the multimethod enters an implicit loop
in which more methods' closures can be applied to the same tuple of
operands.  The loop can terminate if a method's closure throws an
exception or, for @code{:around} and @code{:primary} methods, if it does
not take the special action of calling @func{call-next-method}.

The loop is a bit articulated, so we may have to read the following
descriptions multiple times.  We split the description in two branches:
First a simplified invocation for multimethods having at least one
applicable @code{:primary} method, no @code{:around} methods, and
performing no calls to @func{call-next-method}; then the full
application algorithm.

Here is the simplified branch with no @code{:around} methods and no
calls to @func{call-next-method}:

@enumerate 4
@item
Pop all the @code{:before} methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of operands.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

@item
Pop the next @code{:primary} method from the stack and apply its closure
to the tuple of operands.  The return value of this application is saved
in a temporary location.

@item
Pop all the @code{:after} methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of operands.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

@item
Return the saved return value of the @code{:primary} method.
@end enumerate

@noindent
here is the full application algorithm:

@enumerate 4
@item
Test if this function application originated from a call to
@func{call-next-method} from a @code{:before} or @code{:after} method;
if it has: raise an assertion violation.

@item
Test if this function application originated from a call to
@func{call-next-method} from a @code{:primary} method; if it has:

@enumerate a
@item
If the stack of @code{:primary} methods is empty raise an assertion
violation.

@item
Pop the next @code{:primary} method from the stack and apply its closure
to the tuple of operands.

@item
Break out returning the return value of this application: it becomes the
return value of @func{call-next-method}.
@end enumerate

@item
If the stack of @code{:primary} methods is empty: raise an assertion
violation.  This condition means that the multimethod has no applicable
methods for the tuple of operands.

@item
If the stack of @code{:around} methods is not empty: pop the next
@code{:around} method and apply its closure to the tuple of operands.
Break out returning the return value of this application.

@item
Pop all the @code{:before} methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of operands.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

@item
Pop the next @code{:primary} method from the stack and apply its closure
to the tuple of operands.  The return value of this application is
saved in a temporary location.

@item
Pop all the @code{:after} methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of operands.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

@item
Return the saved return value of the @code{:primary} method.
@end enumerate

The @code{:primary} methods are meant to do the real work of the
function.  Only the most specific is applied to the operands, however
it can use @func{call-next-method} to invoke a least specialised version
and use its return value, and so on recursively until there are no more
next methods.

@code{:before} and @code{:after} methods are meant to execute additional
work before and after the primary methods; for example test pre and post
conditions on the operands.  While @code{:before} methods are applied
from the most specific to the least specific, @code{:after} methods are
applied from the least specific to the most specific.  Notice that the
@code{:after} methods have no access to the return value of the
@code{:primary} methods.

@code{:around} methods are yet another level for performing tasks before
and after the primary methods; only the most specific is applied to the
operands.  It is expected, but not mandatory, that an @code{:around}
method invokes @func{call-next-method}; when such invocations are
performed recursively: they will consume all the applicable
@code{:around} methods, from the most specific to the least specific,
and then will start the application of @code{:before}, @code{:primary}
and @code{:after} methods.

The protocol of application for methods in a starred multimethod is
meant to be the same as the standard method combination for
@acronym{CLOS} methods as defined by the Common Lisp
standard@footnote{See for example (@aurl{} last verified Aug 7, 2013):

@center @url{http:@///www.cs.cmu.edu@//Groups@//AI@//html@//cltl@//clm@//node285.html}
}.

@c page
@node multimethods dispatching
@section How methods are dispatched


Here we attempt the formulation of the rules of method dispatching.  A
method is identified by a couple of values: the signature and the
closure.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Applicability

First we need to understand when a method is applicable to a tuple of
operands:

@enumerate
@item
Methods in a multimethod have the same number of arguments, so the tuple
of operands must match that number.

@item
Given a tuple of operands, position by position, the type of the
method's argument is equal to, or a parent of, the type of the given
operand.
@end enumerate

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Specificity

Now we can understand how to determine which one, among two applicable
methods, is more specific for a tuple of operands.  Let's call the
methods @var{A} and @var{B}.

Notice that it is forbidden to two distinct methods, in the same
multimethod, to have the same signature.

@value{PRJNAME} types support only single inheritance, so if two methods
are applicable: the homologous lists of @uid{}s in their signatures,
have at least one @func{eq?} member (different from @class{top}).

The lists of @uid{}s in the signatures are compared in couples, from the
first argument/first operand to the last argument/last operand, and from
list head to list tail.

@enumerate
@item
If the first @uid{}s are @func{eq?}: the next couple is inspected.

@item
If the @uid{} from @var{B} is a member of the list from @var{A}: @var{A}
is more specific than @var{B}.
@end enumerate

@c page
@node multimethods definers
@section Declaring multimethod definers


The following syntaxes allow the definition and merging of generic
functions; merging multimethods can be useful when two libraries export
generic functions bound to identifiers having the same name.


@deffn Syntax define-generic-definer @meta{definer} @meta{clause} @dots{}
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} operand-type-inspector @meta{func}
Define a new syntax, bound to the identifier @meta{definer}, to be used
to define ordinary generic functions.

The argument of the clause @clause{operand-type-inspector} must be an
expression which, evaluated at run--time, returns a function; such
function, applied to a multimethod operand, must return the list of type
@uid{}s.  This clause is mandatory.  See below for details.

The library @library{vicare language-extensions multimethods} defines
the macro @func{define-generic} as follows:

@example
(define-generic-definer define-generic
  (operand-type-inspector type-unique-identifiers-of))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax define-generic*-definer @meta{definer} @meta{clause} @dots{}
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} operand-type-inspector @meta{func}
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} reverse-before-methods? @meta{bool}
Define a new syntax, bound to the identifier @meta{definer}, to be used
to define starred generic functions.

The argument of the clause @clause{operand-type-inspector} must be an
expression which, evaluated at run--time, returns a function; such
function, applied to a multimethod operand, must return the list of type
@uid{}s.  This clause is mandatory.  See below for details.

The argument of the clause @clause{reverse-before-methods?} must be a
boolean datum: @true{} if the methods qualified as @code{:before} must
be reversed and so applied from the least specific to the most specific;
@false{} if the standard method protocol must be adopted.  This clause
is optional: the default is to use the standard method protocol.  See
below for details.

The library @library{vicare language-extensions multimethods} defines
the macro @func{define-generic*} as follows:

@example
(define-generic*-definer define-generic*
  (operand-type-inspector  type-unique-identifiers-of)
  (reverse-before-methods? #f))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn {Auxiliary Syntax} operand-type-inspector @meta{func}
The clause @clause{operand-type-inspector} allows the specification of a
function to map a multimethod operand to the list of @uid{}s
representing its type.  @meta{func} must be an expression which,
evaluated at run--time, returns a function.

When merging generic functions: the type inspector function is the one
of the multimethod in which the others are merged.

Usually the @clause{operand-type-inspector} clause selects a wrapper for
@func{type-unique-identifiers-of}.
@end deffn


@deffn {Auxiliary Syntax} reverse-before-methods? @meta{bool}
The default methods composition protocol states that @code{:before} and
@code{:around} methods are evaluated from the most specific to the least
specific, while @code{:after} methods are evaluated from the least
specific to the most specific.

When the clause @clause{reverse-before-methods?} is used and @meta{bool}
is @true{}: the order of @code{:before} methods is reversed to ``from
the least specific to the most specific'' prior to evaluating them.
@ref{multimethods methods} for an example of why this customisation is
useful.
@end deffn

@section Built-in multimethod definers


@defun type-unique-identifiers-of @var{obj}
Object--type inspector function; return the list of @uid{}s in the type
hierarchy of @var{obj}.  When this function does not recognise an
object's type: the return value just identifies @var{obj} as of type
@class{top}.  This function can recognise automatically all the
instances of types declared by @func{define-record-type}.  This function
recognises only the following built--in types:

@example
<compound-condition> <record> <struct> <hashtable>
<positive-fixnum> <negative-fixnum> <zero-fixnum>
<positive-bignum> <negative-bignum>
<positive-flonum> <negative-flonum>

@end defun


@deffn Syntax define-generic @meta{name} @meta{formals} @meta{clause} @dots{}
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} merge-with-multimethods @meta{generic} @dots{}
Define a new ordinary multimethod (a macro) and bind it to
@meta{name}.  The number of arguments is specified by @meta{formals}: a
list of identifiers, one for each argument; the list is used only to
determine the number of arguments (it can be used to document the
intended meaning of the arguments).

When the optional @clause{merge-with-multimethods} clause is used: the
internal methods table is initialised to the union of the methods tables
from the @meta{generic} arguments, which must be ordinary multimethod
identifiers.  The union is performed by visiting arguments from left to
right; when two methods have the same signature, the one from the
leftmost multimethod takes precedence.
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax define-generic* @meta{name} @meta{formals} @meta{clause} @dots{}
@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} merge-with-multimethods @meta{generic} @dots{}
Define a new starred multimethod (a macro) and bind it to

Add a new method to an already existent generic function @meta{generic},
either ordinary or starred:

@itemize
@item
When the @meta{qualifier} argument is not present or it is the
@code{:primary} syntax: @meta{generic} can be either an ordinary or
starred generic function.

@item
When the @meta{qualifier} argument is the @code{:before}, @code{:after} or
@code{:around} syntax: @meta{generic} must be a starred generic
function.
@end itemize

The list of @meta{arg-spec} specifies the type of the arguments for
which this method specialises the generic function; an @meta{arg-spec}
can be:

@table @code
@item (brace @meta{arg} @meta{type})
Where @meta{arg} is the formal name of the argument, @meta{type} the
type identifier of the expected operand, @func{brace} is the identifier
exported by @library{vicare} and reexported by @library{vicare
language-extensions multimethods}.

@item @meta{arg}
Where @meta{arg} is the formal name of the argument.  In this case the
type defaults to @class{top}, which is interpreted as parent of every
other type (and so it has the least specificity).
@end table

If the @meta{generic} function name comes with @meta{type} arguments:
such arguments specify the type of the return values.  The types are
used to validate the return values of the method's closure object, but
they do @strong{not} constitute the types of values returned by the
multimethod application.

If a method is defined with the same signature of an already registered
method: the old method is overwritten by the new one.

In the lexical context of the @meta{body} forms: the fluid syntax
@syntax{__who__} is bound to the quoted name of the multimethod,
@meta{generic}.

@deffnx {Auxiliary Syntax} :primary

Add a new method to an already existent multimethod @meta{generic},
either ordinary or starred:

@itemize
@item
When the @meta{qualifier} argument is not present or it is the

@item
When the @meta{qualifier} argument is the @code{:before}, @code{:after}
or @code{:around} syntax: @meta{generic} must be a starred multimethod.
@end itemize

@meta{types} must be a list of type identifiers for which this method
specialises the generic function.  @meta{closure} must be an expression
which, evaluated at run--time, returns the method's implementation
closure.  It is responsibility of the programmer to make sure that
@meta{types} and @meta{closure} are coherent.

@node multimethods next
@section Invoking the next method


The library @library{vicare language-extensions multimethods} makes use
of parameters to implement the ``next method'' facility@footnote{A
``traditional'' way to make the bindings @func{call-next-method} and
@func{next-method?} available in the body of methods (rejected by this
implementation) is to add two arguments to the function at expand time;
the following method function:

@example
(lambda (arg1 arg2)
  ---)
@end example

@noindent
is changed to:

@example
(lambda (call-next-method next-method? arg1 arg2)
  ---)
@end example

@noindent
this way the bindings are available only to the methods.  This
implementation requires the source syntax object of the method to be
available at expansion time, and to hold a @func{lambda} form.}; this
allows, for example, functions from foreign libraries to be used
directly as methods, through @syntax{add-method}.  The bindings are
available also to code outside the method implementations, but this is
not a big problem.
