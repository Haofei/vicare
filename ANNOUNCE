Subject: [announce] Vicare Scheme revision 0.2d1

                             Vicare Scheme
                             =============


Vicare Scheme is an R6RS compliant fork of Ikarus Scheme, aiming to be a
native compiler for R6 Scheme producing single threaded programs running
on  Intel x86  32-bit processors;  Vicare  is officially  not ready  for
64-bit machines.  "Vicare" is pronounced  the etruscan way.  Vicare is a
fork of  Ikarus Scheme, an  almost R6RS compliant implementation  of the
Scheme programming language by Abdulaziz Ghuloum.

collection of R6 Scheme libraries:

Notes for revision 0.2d1
------------------------

* It  appears that  Ikarus' mailing  list is  no more  working,  so this
  project  now   has  its  own   mailing  list  for   announcements  and
  discussions:

	     <http://groups.google.com/group/vicare-users>

* Added library (vicare) exporting the same bindings of (ikarus).

* Review of bytevector functions.

* Introduced  the configuration  option "--disable-arguments-validation"
  to exclude  at expansion-time code validating  arguments to functions.
  At present not many modules support this feature.

* Added  options to  "vicare": --print-assembly,  --print-optimizer.  At
  present neither very useful, nor human-friendly.
