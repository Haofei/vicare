Subject: [announce] Vicare Scheme revision 0.2d2

                             Vicare Scheme
                             =============


Vicare Scheme is an R6RS compliant fork of Ikarus Scheme, aiming to be a
native compiler for R6 Scheme producing single threaded programs running
on  Intel x86  32-bit processors;  Vicare  is officially  not ready  for
64-bit machines.  "Vicare" is pronounced the etruscan way.

  The latest version of this package can be downloaded from Github:

            <http://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare/downloads>

the home page of the Vicare project is at:

               <http://marcomaggi.github.com/vicare.html>

development takes place at:

                 <http://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare/>

this project has a mailing list:

	     <http://groups.google.com/group/vicare-users>

  It  is suggested to  use Vicare  Scheme along  with Nausicaa,  a large
collection of R6 Scheme libraries:

Notes for revision 0.2d2
------------------------

* The  default   list  of  library   file  extensions  now   holds  just
  ".vicare.sls" and ".sls"; the new option --more-file-extensions allows
  to restore the old behviour of searching for many file extensions plus
  the "main" file trick.

* Some documentation has been written; other reviewed.

* More code reviewed with support for optional arguments validation.

* Updated  functions to  properly rely  on I/O  port's own  buffer mode;
  DISPLAY, WRITE, NEWLINE do not force a flush anymore.

* Added  SET-PORT-BUFFER-MODE! to  reconfigure the  mode of  an existing
  port.


Notes for revision 0.2d1
------------------------

* It  appears that  Ikarus' mailing  list is  working no  more,  so this
  project  now   has  its  own   mailing  list  for   announcements  and
  discussions:

	     <http://groups.google.com/group/vicare-users>

* Added library (vicare) exporting the same bindings of (ikarus).

* Review of bytevector functions.

* Introduced  the configuration  option "--disable-arguments-validation"
  to exclude  at expansion-time code validating  arguments to functions.
  At present only a few modules support this feature.

* Review  of command line  options and  execution modes.   Added options
  "--print-assembly"  and "--print-optimizer",  at present  neither very
  useful, nor human-friendly.
